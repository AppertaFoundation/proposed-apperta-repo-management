# Proposed Apperta Repository Management
Proposal for a policy for management of non-Apperta repositories which respects autonomy of project originators while strongly protecting Apperta's community investment. 

### Request For Comment

* Movement of a GitHub repository involves considerable work, none of which improves the quality of the code, the features of the project, and much of which can actually cause harm to the project.

### THEREFORE:

1. Repositories **SHOULD** remain in the GitHub Organisation of the originator, **UNLESS** the Apperta Technical Subcomittee deem that there is a significant risk of loss of the community's asset through a future closure of the source code, in which case the Apperta Foundation will fork the repository to the Apperta Foundation GitHub organisation.

1. Originators **SHOULD** have demonstrably open source code using a public source code management tool (such as GitHub) 

1. Source code **SHOULD** be up to date with the latest development tip. 

1. Originators **SHOULD** demonstrate a willingness to accept contributions from the community such as Issues and Pull Requests.

1. Live, public internet-facing demonstration instances of the supported apps **SHOULD** be maintained by the originators, under subdomains of the apperta.org top level domain if appropriate.

1. Apperta **WILL** maintain a simple list or directory of such supported apps and components; their respective subdomain URLs; and appropriate documentation so as to make a demonstration interaction possible.

1. Apperta **MAY** download code snapshots from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

1. Apperta **MAY** fork a code repository from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

1. Originators **SHOULD** display the ['Supported By Apperta' badge](https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/apperta-image-assets/blob/master/supported_by_apperta_lores.png) on the repositories which have been supported by Apperta, and may demonstrate attribution in other ways if they so wish.

1. All Apperta-supported projects **SHOULD** have a clear copyright notice* stating the copyright owner, and an equally clear [OSI-approved open source license](https://opensource.org/licenses).

1. In exceptional circumstances, variations to this policy may be discussed and agreed by the Apperta Board, for individual projects.

## Definitions
* Apperta = "The Apperta Foundation CIC"
* Originators = "The individual, gorup of individuals, organisation, company, or other institution from which the original open source project was created"
