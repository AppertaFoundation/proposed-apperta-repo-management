# proposed-apperta-repo-management
Proposal for a policy for management of non-Apperta repositories which respects autonomy of project originators while strongly protecting Apperta's community investment. 

Request For Comment

* Movement of a GitHub repository involves considerable work, none of which improves the quality of the code, the features of the project, and much of which can actually cause harm to the project. THEREFORE:

* Repositories SHOULD remain in the GitHub Organisation of the originator, UNLESS the Apperta Technical Subcomittee deem that there is a significant risk of loss of the community's asset through a future closure of the source code.

* Live 'demo' instances of the supported apps SHOULD be maintained under subdomains of the apperta.org TLD

* There SHOULD be a directory of such supported apps and their respective subdomain URLs and appropriate documentation so as to make a demonstration interaction possible.

* Apperta MAY download code snapshots from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

* Apperta MAY fork a code repository from the originators' repository at the point of completion of a project or at any other time, in order to protect their investment in development of projects.

* Originators SHOULD display the 'Supported By Apperta' badge on the repositories which have been supported by Apperta, and may demostrate attribution in other ways if they so wish.
